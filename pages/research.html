	<h3 class="left">Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)</h3>

	<p>
        Roughly 14 years after first launching from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia, GRACE continues to provide use with a time history of Earth's evolving gravity field. A joint NASA/DLR geodesy mission, GRACE has been an invaluable resource for tracking large-scale flooding, droughts, and glacial melting.

        Led by the University of Texas's CSR, centers at NASA JPL and GSFC, as well as Germany's GFZ direct the release of periodic time-variable gravity solutions - snapshots of the Earth's gravity field. At CCAR, I am part of a group of researchers using these solutions to study Greenland and Antarctic ice mass loss, hydrological signals, and other indicators of global climate change.

	<h3 class="left">GRACE Mass Concentrations (Mascons)</h3>

	<p>
        A newer form of gravity field solutions, mascons have seen development in recent years as a way of better characterizing the spatial variability of Earth's gravity. You can imagine these mascons as discrete pixels located across the Earth's surface, each with their own small gravity signal that, when viewed as a whole, sum up to Earth's full gravity field. Because these mascons are in discrete locations across the globe, regional studies of water storage changes are simplified.

        My work has included performing Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses on mascons solutions from GSFC and JPL to gain a better understanding of the signals captured by GRACE mascon solutions. Additionally, I have worked at GSFC over the past three summers helping to implement and test their mascon process and their resulting solutions.

	<h3 class="left">Daily Mascon Solutions</h3>

	<p>
        One of the greatest challenges with GRACE is finding a balance between the spatial and temporal resolutions of GRACE solutions. While most centers develop monthly snapshots, others have tried to reduce that to 10 days or fewer. The trade off is this: As you shrink the number of days included in a solution and increase the temporal resolution of that set of solutions, you also decrease the spatial resolution. This is similar to how a video camera might capture either high resolution videos at 30 frames per second or lower resolution videos at 60 frames per second.
    </p>

	<p>
        Mascon solutions offer many interesting possibilities with increasing the temporal resolution of GRACE solutions without negatively affecting their spatial resolution. My work focuses on developing daily-updated gravity estimates. The goal is pretty simple: we want to be able to know as quickly as possible and with the best possible timing accuracy what GRACE sees each day. This would then allow for improvements to hydrology modelling and forecasting.
