        I am a PhD Candidate in Aerospace Engineering Sciences, working for <a href="http://cires.colorado.edu/people/nerem/">Dr. Steve Nerem</a>.  My research focuses on time-variable Earth gravity, using <a href="http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/">GRACE</a> science data to studying hydrologic and cryospheric surface mass changes.  These changes are indicative of groundwater storage changes (for example, due to drought or flooding) and glacial ice-mass loss due to melting, and are major indicators of global climate change.

        More specifically, my research utilizes surface mass concentrations (or "mascons") to represent the gravity field and extract useful information about surface mass variations on global, regional, and local scales.  A more detailed description can be found by selecting the "Research" tab in the navigation bar.
