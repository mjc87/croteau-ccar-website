	<h3>Bio:</h3>

	<p>
        I am originally from just outside Baltimore, MD, and am a graduate of the University of Notre Dame. I'm an avid fan of both the Baltimore Orioles and ND Fighting Irish, and have been traveling with my Dad to see the Orioles in Spring Training baseball in Florida every year since I was 4. I'm a son of southerners, was raised on Catholic values, and am the only Croteau male of my generation dating back to at least my great-grandparents. I'm proud of my southern, French, and Italian heritages. My parents continue to be my greatest role models.

        After undergrad I taught high school math and science for two years at a Catholic school in Baton Rouge, LA through Notre Dame's <a href="https://ace.nd.edu" target="blank_">Alliance for Catholic Education</a>. While there I was the head coach of the women's softball team, where we won a district championship. I was also an assistant football coach - first as Freshmen defensive coordinator, then as Varsity running backs coach.

	<h3>Outdoors:</h3>

	<p>Other than the great research and graduate program, one of the big draws to Colorado for me was the skiing. I buy a pass each year, and try to ski a dozen or so times per season. I also enjoy snowshoeing and hiking, and have more recently gotten into cycling a bit.</p>

	<p>Growing up I played baseball and rugby, helping my high school Calvert Hall to win the Potomac Rugby Union "C" championship my freshman year. I love to waterski, played sand volleyball frequently at Notre Dame, and enjoy pretty much any pick-up or intramural sport.</p>

	<h3>DIY:</h3>

	<p>I worked in home remodeling and construction over the summers during college, and enjoy working on home projects small and large. From helping finish my sister and brother-in-law's basement, to building a bench for my house in Boulder, to recently working on a Habitat for Humanity build, I've been lucky enough to find projects here and there that keep my skills somewhat fresh.</p>

	<p>More recently, I've gotten into smaller projects using the Raspberry Pi. I'm most proud of the Christmas lights display I've set up the past few Decembers that flashes lights on my house to various Christmas tunes each night.
